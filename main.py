##Step 1: Load data

#training_folder = "./data/train"
#validation_folder = "./data/valid"
#testing_folder = "./data/test"

##Step 2: Dataset Summary & Exploration (not necessary?)

#number of training/validation/test examples etc

#images and histograms

##Step 3: Design and Test a Model Architecture

#Equalize histograms of training samples - by generation of additional, transformed images

#Image normalization and grayscale conversion

#Model Architecture

#Train, Validate and Test the Model

#Train accuracy

##Step 4: Test a Model on New Images

#Load and Output the Images

#Predict the Sign Type for Each Image

#Analyze Performance
